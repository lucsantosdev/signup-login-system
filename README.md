## 🚀 Project Description  
This project is a responsive Sing Up-Login system with user authentication using Node JS, Express JS, MongoDB and Bycrypt. This system consists of a registration form page – where the data of registered users is stored in a database –, a login form page and a home page with authenticated access.

## ✨ Functionalities  
- **Data Storage:** Through integration with the Mongodb database, it is possible to store the data of registered users (name, email and password). 
- **Hash Password:** for secure password data storage.
- **Authenticated Access:** for secure access for registered users only.
- **Responsiveness:** for access on different devices.
